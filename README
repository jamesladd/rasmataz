RASMATAZ - An Assembler Front End (Driver) / Architecture Neutral Assembler

This is an experiement in using Ruby's DSL abilities to make an assembler.

This is not a copy of Wilson, it is more like a MASM.

I intend to make use of this project at some point to create an assembler
for a virtual machine I plan to make.

Right now, this just shows the neat features of Ruby for making DSL's.
