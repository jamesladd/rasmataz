RASMATAZ - An Assembler Front End (Driver) / Architecture Neutral Assembler

This is an experiement in using Ruby's DSL abilities to make an assembler, the goal of which
is to see how little code is needed given what Ruby does 'out-of-the-box'.

I intend to make use of this project at some point to create an assembler for a virtual machine
and language I plan to make. It does a few things right now, but mostly it shows the neat features
of Ruby for makeing DSL's.


This is not a copy of Wilson, it is more like a MASM.

To play with rasmataz:

load 

   irb
   > irb_load 'example.rasm', nil

dump registers

   > registers

dump stack

   > stack

dump memory

   > memory

dump labels

   > labels

run program

  > go  

(Note: go is not implemented yet.)
