RASMATAZ - An Assembler Front End (Driver) / Architecture Neutral Assembler

This is an experiement in using Ruby's DSL abilities to make an assembler the goal of which
is to see how little code is needed given what Ruby does 'out-of-the-box'.

This is not a copy of Wilson, it is more like a MASM.

I intend to make use of this project at some point to create an assembler for a virtual machine I plan to make.

Right now, this just shows the neat features of Ruby for making DSL's.

To play with rasmataz:

load 

   irb
   > irb_load 'example.rasm', nil

dump registers

   > registers

dump stack

   > stack

dump memory

   > memory

run program

  > go  

(Note: go is not implemented yet.)
